SPCPeel Website Github - Private - Ronit Nayak


I have decided to upload this file onto Github as a means to keep track of everything and allow everything to be stored in an easy to 
manage. This also allows me to routinely check over the code and see if anything goes wrong

My internship is over and I have been allowed to make this code public. This is the code for an old website that I made. Is currently not in use.
